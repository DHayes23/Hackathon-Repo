# Intended Purpose of This Website:

  - The purpose of this website is to encourage women of all age groups that a career in both Software Development and the Tech Industry as a whole, would not only be an amazing journey for them, which would change their lives in so many positive ways, but it would also provide the industry with the much needed diversity they seek to encourage in their workplace enviornments.

  -  This website has combined resources from throughout the internet and constructed 3 individualized pathways that are tailored towards women of all ages. 

  - There is a learning pathway targeted at younger girls (2nd level and under), that may be unaware that this career path is something that is not only available to them, but is also something that is highly encouraged among the Tech Industry.

  - There is a learning pathway that is targeted at Female College Students which lays out the path most suited for them to follow. 

  - There is also a learning pathway tailored to Women who may have only discovered this potential career later in life and who may want to attempt a career change.

These colours provide a high level of contrast for users with impaired vison, as confirmed in the testing section below. They also add to the overall goal of creating a clear and engaging design ethos. The colors were chosen in conjunction with the background image to present a smooth, related connection across the application. This helps provide consistency to the overall aesthetic flow of the user experience.

## **TESTING.**

- ### **HTML Testing**

- ### **CSS Testing**

<p align="center">
    <img src=""?raw=true alt=""></p>

- ### **Chrome Dev Tools - Lighthouse - Testing**

  The Chrome dev tool - Lighthouse - Tests the overall performance, Accessibility, Web Development best practices and SEO. The following results were confirmed:

<p align="center">
    <img src=""?raw=true alt=""></p>

- ### **Responsiveness Testing**

The following sites were used to test the web applications responsiveness: [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) and [Media Genesis Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/)

The 'Am I responsive generator' result image has been used at the start of this readme file. Please see the image at the top for the results. This page focuses on the following image viewport sizes -
  Desktop
  1600x992px scaled down to scale(0.3181)
  Laptop
  1280x802px scaled down to scale(0.277)
  Tablet
  768x1024px scaled down to scale(0.219)
  Mobile
  320x480px scaled down to scale(0.219). The site results indicate good performance on all viewport sizes.

The Media Genesis page gives the option to test the page on several different viewport screen sizes from Desktop 24 inch 1920 x 1200px resolution all the way down to the mobile viewport size of 320 x 480px. The site performed very well on all viewport size options.

- ### **Contrast/ Accessibility Testing**

The [Wave Accessibilty testing tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to check to test the page contrast and accessibilty of the application.

The colour contrast was AAA rated.

    <img src=""?raw=true alt=" Wave accesibility tool testing results"></p>

- ### **JavaScript Testing**

[JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check the quality and functionality of the JavaScript code. No significant issues were recorded and the rest of the feedback was directed at tidying up the syntax. 

- ### **User Testing**

All page links and button functionality were tested including ascertaining that all social media links opened in separate tabs and that all icon play buttons were correctly configured and provided the correct feedback to the user, as indicated. The page was stringently put through it's paces.
